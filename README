NAME
    App::perlhl - application class for syntax highlighting Perl source code

VERSION
    version 0.004

SYNOPSIS
        use App::perlhl;
        App::perlhl->new({})->run({}, \@ARGV);

DESCRIPTION
    App::perlhl is the application class backing perlhl.

METHODS
  new
    This instantiates a new App::perlhl object. It takes a hashref of
    options:

    *   html

        If true, the output will be an HTML fragment suitable for publishing
        as part of a web page. NOTE: In the future, this might output a
        whole valid document.

    The default is to output ANSI colour codes suitable for printing to any
    reasonable shell or terminal (which probably means you have the one
    that'll break -- well it works on mine, so neener neener).

  run
    Unsurprisingly, this runs the application. The method takes a hashref of
    options, and an arrayref of filenames to highlight. If there are no
    filenames, defaults to "STDIN".

  Options
    *   version

        If present, the application will print version data and exit.
